The answer to the "How Do I Deposit?" would be (just a draft, not covering everything):

On the "Dashboard" page, there are two sections: "Your supplies" and "Your borrows."
The "Your supplies" section shows the assets available for deposit on AAVE markets. In addition, there is a filter called "Show assets with 0 balance" that you can deselect to see only assets that you have in your wallet.
You can access more information about the market for the asset of interest by clicking the "Details" button.
