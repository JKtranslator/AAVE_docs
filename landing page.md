The other one shows the wallet currently connected with the website and the network where this wallet is. It also offers the option to copy the wallet address, view it on the block explorer, and disconnect the app from the wallet.  

# Dashboard

The first information available on the **Dashboard** main area is the wallet's current balance (net worth) and the APY of this position.
Below are two sections: **Your supplies** and **Your borrows.**

## Assets to supply Overview

The **Your supplies** section shows the assets available for deposit on AAVE markets. In addition, the user can deselect the "Show assets with 0 balance" filter to show only assets with a balance on the wallet connected.

Each asset row on this section shows the **Wallet balance** and the expected **APY** when supplying it to the protocol. In addition, there is also the information if this asset can be used as collateral for borrowing.

Two buttons trigger the actions available in this section: **Supply** and **Details**.
